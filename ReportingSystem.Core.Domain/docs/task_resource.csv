"TASK-002","Implement Jint Engine Wrapper and Sandboxing","C#/.NET","Jint,Security,Resource Management","High","8.3","Senior","1.2","6.9","1","true","TASK-001","true","Medium","4","Requires deep understanding of Jint security constraints and .NET resource management. High-risk task.","Could be assigned to a mid-level developer but would require 50% more time and extensive review from Lead Architect.","Incorrect sandboxing configuration could lead to a critical security vulnerability (RISK-001).","Dedicated security-focused code review by Lead Architect. Implement automated tests for each security constraint.","1.25","1.66","0.83","2","1"

Requires expertise in .NET internals to prevent dependency conflicts and memory leaks.","A simpler loading mechanism without AssemblyLoadContext, but this would introduce high risk of dependency hell (RISK-002).","High risk of service instability if implemented incorrectly. A single faulty plug-in could crash the main application.","Implement with extensive integration testing using sample 'good', 'bad', and 'conflicting' plug-ins. Rigorous code review.","2.06","2.74","1.37","4","3"

Needs coordination with DevOps for CI integration.","Manual performance testing, but this is not repeatable and fails to meet NFR enforcement requirements.","CI environment variability could lead to flaky test results (RISK-004).","Run tests on dedicated, standardized CI agents. Document the expected hardware baseline for the benchmark.","1.25","1.66","0.83","","2"
