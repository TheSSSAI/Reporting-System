"RISK-R001","Resource Constraint","The single Frontend Developer is a critical bottleneck and single point of failure. Any illness, departure, or underestimation of task complexity will directly delay the project timeline.","High","High","[""TASK-017"",""TASK-018"",""TASK-019"",""TASK-022""]","3","Immediately hire one contract Senior Frontend Developer for the project duration (8-10 weeks).","De-scope non-essential UI features. Initiate cross-training with a backend developer, accepting a 50% productivity loss on their tasks.","Any frontend task slipping by more than 2 days.","30000","2 weeks to source and onboard contractor."
"RISK-002","Technical","A flaw in the Jint sandbox configuration allows a malicious script to bypass constraints, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server or a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-002"",""TASK-004"",""TASK-020""]","4","Implement dedicated security code reviews for all Jint-related code. Use static analysis tools to flag risky code patterns. Maintain a suite of negative tests that try to break the sandbox.","Utilize the system-wide feature flag to immediately disable the data transformation feature in production if a vulnerability is found. Prepare an emergency patch release.","Alerts on 'SandboxConstraintViolation' metrics from Prometheus.","","Ongoing."
"RISK-R002","Capacity Overload","Backend developers are significantly over-allocated (120-154% utilization), leading to high risk of burnout, reduced code quality, and cascading delays across all backend-dependent tasks.","Very High","High","[""All backend tasks in Sprints 1, 2, and 4""]","4","Hire one contract Senior Backend Developer for the project duration to absorb tasks like TASK-026 (MongoDB) and TASK-030 (PDK).","De-scope the PDK deliverable (TASK-030) to a future release. Shift all non-critical path tasks from Sprint 1/2 to a new Sprint 5, extending the timeline.","Weekly review of burndown charts and developer feedback.","28000","2 weeks to source and onboard contractor."
