"Cross-training","Siloed frontend expertise creates a project bottleneck.","Dedicate 4 hours per sprint for a backend developer to pair-program with the frontend developer on non-critical UI components and bug fixes.","Develops a backup resource for frontend maintenance, reducing the single-point-of-failure risk by 30% over 8 weeks.","32","8 weeks","Backend developer can independently resolve low-complexity UI bugs by the end of the project.","Mitigates risk of a 2-week project delay, valued at over $30,000."
"Task Distribution","Backend developers are severely overloaded, while Lead Architect has significant buffer capacity.","Re-assign architecturally complex but implementation-heavy tasks like TASK-029 (Plugin Loader, 13.7h) from the overloaded backend developer to the Lead Architect.","Reduces Backend Dev 2's utilization in Sprint 1 from 32% to a more manageable level, improving focus and quality on their remaining tasks.","","Immediate (Planning Phase)","More balanced utilization across the backend team, with no single developer exceeding 100% allocation in any sprint.","Prevents developer burnout and reduces risk of rework, saving an estimated 20-30 hours of lost productivity."
