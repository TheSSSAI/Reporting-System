"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the Jint sandbox configuration or a vulnerability in the Jint library itself allows a malicious script to bypass constraints, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server (CLR access) or a Denial of Service (DoS) attack through resource exhaustion.","3","5","15","High","Core data transformation execution (REQ-FUNC-DTR-001, REQ-SEC-DTR-001). Affects all reports that use transformation scripts, potentially leading to system-wide compromise or outage.","Complexity of securely configuring a JavaScript engine within a .NET environment. Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the third-party Jint library. Human error in applying security constraints in all code paths.","Implement a dedicated, non-overridable 'secure by default' configuration for all Jint engine instances. Conduct rigorous, security-focused peer reviews for all code interacting with the Jint wrapper. Integrate static analysis tools to flag any attempts to enable CLR access.","Utilize the system-wide feature flag (REQ-OPER-IMP-001) to immediately disable the entire data transformation feature if a critical vulnerability is discovered in production. Prepare an emergency patch release procedure.","Prometheus alert fires for a spike in 'SandboxConstraintViolation' metrics. Any exception other than the expected Jint runtime exceptions originating from the Jint engine wrapper. Unexplained high CPU or memory usage correlated with job execution.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","A poorly written custom connector (plug-in DLL) causes instability in the main application service, leading to memory leaks, unhandled exceptions that crash the service, or dependency conflicts that prevent other connectors or the application from functioning.","4","4","16","High","Data ingestion for any report using custom connectors (US-041, US-042). A service crash would impact all system functionality, including scheduled jobs and UI access.","Inherent risk of executing third-party, untrusted code. Complexity of the .NET `AssemblyLoadContext` for ensuring true dependency isolation.","Strictly implement plug-in loading using isolated `AssemblyLoadContext` for each connector to prevent dependency conflicts. Develop a comprehensive Plug-in Development Kit (PDK) with clear documentation and examples for error handling, resource management, and cancellation token support.","If a faulty connector is identified, the IT Support user must stop the service, remove the offending DLL from the 'plugins' folder, and restart the service. The system must start correctly without the faulty plugin.","Correlation of service crashes or memory leak alerts with the execution of jobs using a specific custom connector. A high number of job failures specifically for reports using a new custom connector.","Lead Architect","2024-11-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","The in-place MSI upgrade process fails due to a database migration error or file permission issue, leaving the application in a non-functional or corrupted state and requiring a complex manual recovery, potentially leading to data loss.","3","5","15","High","Application upgrades and maintenance (US-005). A failed upgrade can cause extended downtime and loss of customer trust.","Complexity of managing state (files, database, Windows service) during an upgrade. EF Core migrations can fail if the database schema has been manually altered. Rollback logic in WiX custom actions is notoriously difficult to implement correctly.","Enforce a strict policy that all EF Core migrations must be reversible (i.e., have a functional `Down()` method). The installer will force the user to acknowledge a recommendation to back up their system (US-103) before proceeding. Automate upgrade testing from version N to N+1 in the CI/CD pipeline using dedicated VMs.","Provide a detailed manual recovery guide in the administration documentation, including steps to restore the database from a backup, manually replace application files, and re-register the Windows service.","Installer log file indicates a failure in a custom action, particularly the database migration step. The Windows Service fails to start after an upgrade with errors related to database connectivity or missing methods.","DevOps/Build Engineer","2024-12-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Performance","The transformation engine fails to meet the performance NFR (REQ-PERF-DTR-002: 10MB JSON in <10s), making the feature unusable for customers with large datasets and resulting in job timeouts or significant performance degradation.","3","4","12","Medium","Performance validation and execution of data transformations (WI-005). Failure to meet this NFR could be a breach of contract and severely limit the feature's applicability.","Potential performance bottlenecks in the data marshalling process between the .NET CLR and the Jint JavaScript engine. Inefficient garbage collection or object allocation within the Jint library for very large object graphs.","Integrate the performance benchmark test (WI-005) into the CI pipeline and fail the build on regression. Conduct early-stage profiling of the data marshalling process. Document scripting best practices for performance (e.g., avoiding deep recursion, efficient loop construction).","If performance targets cannot be met for very large files, update documentation to define a 'recommended maximum' dataset size for transformation and advise users to perform large-scale transformations in an upstream ETL process.","The automated performance benchmark test in the CI/CD pipeline fails. Production monitoring via Prometheus shows a trend of increasing script execution times for jobs with similar data sizes.","QA Lead","2024-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Resource","The project is delayed due to the unavailability of a complete and stable testing environment, specifically the required OPC UA server, mock licensing API, and various SQL database instances, leading to inadequate testing and feature delivery bottlenecks.","4","3","12","Medium","All testing related to database connectors (US-034), OPC UA connectors (US-036), and the entire licensing feature set (EPIC-007).","Underestimation of the effort required to provision and maintain complex, specialized test infrastructure. Dependencies on external teams or services to provide necessary test endpoints.","Allocate dedicated time and ownership in the project plan for test environment setup. Use Docker and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to automate the provisioning of databases and mock services. Prioritize the creation of a stable mock licensing API early in the project.","For highly specialized components like the OPC UA server, create a shared, remote test lab environment accessible to all developers and QA. Accept a limited scope of testing if a specific environment cannot be provisioned, and document the associated risk.","Development tasks being blocked due to a missing test dependency. QA reports an inability to validate acceptance criteria due to an unavailable or unstable test environment.","Project Manager / Engineering Manager","2024-11-05","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The .NET Data Protection API keys, which are used to encrypt all transformation scripts at rest, are lost or become inaccessible due to server migration or OS corruption, resulting in the permanent and irreversible loss of all customer-created scripts.","2","5","10","Medium","Data persistence and retrieval for all transformation scripts (REQ-SEC-DTR-003, WI-009). This affects the entire system's ability to run reports that use transformations.","The DPAPI key ring is stored locally on the server by default. IT Support may be unaware of its importance and fail to back it up during server maintenance or migration.","Create prominent documentation in the Installation and Administration Guide that explicitly details the location and importance of the DPAPI key ring, instructing administrators to back it up as part of their standard server backup procedures. Link to official Microsoft documentation on DPAPI key management.","The only contingency is to restore the DPAPI key ring from a backup. If no backup exists, the data is unrecoverable. The plan is to document this risk transparently so administrators understand the consequence of not having a backup.","The application fails to start, with a critical error in the logs related to `System.Security.Cryptography.CryptographicException` during the initialization of the data protection services. A health check fails to decrypt a test payload.","Technical Writer","2024-11-20","Not Started"
"RISK-007","External","The external cloud-based licensing service experiences a prolonged outage, causing all deployed instances to fail their periodic validation, enter the 7-day grace period, and eventually revert to a limited Trial Mode, disrupting all paying customers.","2","5","10","Medium","All licensing and feature entitlement logic (US-015, US-016, EPIC-007). This is a business-critical risk that affects the entire customer base and revenue.","Dependency on a single external service for a critical function. Potential for network partitions, service provider outages, or API failures.","The primary mitigation is the 7-day grace period (US-016), which allows time for the external service to recover without immediate customer impact. Implement a resilient HTTP client (using Polly) with exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns for all calls to the licensing service.","Establish a documented support procedure for issuing temporary, time-limited emergency license keys that can be applied manually by customers in the event of a catastrophic, multi-day outage of the cloud licensing service.","The application's Prometheus metrics show a high rate of `license_validation_failures`. The central monitoring system for the cloud licensing service itself raises an alert for an outage.","Product Manager","2024-11-10","Not Started"
