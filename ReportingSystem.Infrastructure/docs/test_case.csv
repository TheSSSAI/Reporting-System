"TEST-SEC-001","Data Transformation Engine Security","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify the Jint engine sandbox correctly enforces all configured constraints (timeout, memory, statement count, and CLR access) to prevent resource exhaustion and unauthorized access.","Critical - A sandbox escape or DoS vulnerability could compromise the entire host system's stability and security.","High","The Jint Transformation Engine is configured with strict constraints: Timeout=5s, Memory=50MB, StatementCount=10000, CLR Access=Denied.","1. Execute a script with an infinite loop (`while(true){}`). 2. Execute a script that allocates a large array (`new Array(10 * 1024 * 1024)`). 3. Execute a script with a loop exceeding the statement count. 4. Execute a script attempting to access `System.IO.File`.","1. Throws `TimeoutException` after ~5s. 2. Throws `MemoryLimitExceededException`. 3. Throws `StatementsCountOverflowException`. 4. Throws a security exception or is blocked.","Four separate malicious JavaScript files, each designed to trigger one specific constraint.","xUnit, Jint, Moq","12","24","8","REQ-SEC-DTR-001, REQ-SEC-DTR-002","Integration environment with the backend service running.","All four test cases must throw the expected, specific exception and be logged to the SecurityViolationLog.","System is vulnerable to DoS attacks or potential RCE.","Every commit to the transformation engine module.","Low","None","This is a primary security test.

"TEST-FUNC-002","Script Preview Workflow","Functional","End-to-End","High","true","High","Verify the full end-to-end workflow of an Administrator previewing a script using both sample JSON and a live data connector.","High - A broken preview feature severely hampers the development and debugging of transformation scripts, a core product capability.","High","User is authenticated as an Administrator. At least one data connector is configured. A sample transformation script is available.","1. Navigate to the script editor UI. 2. Paste a transformation script into the editor. 3. Paste sample JSON into the input pane and click 'Preview'. 4. Verify the output is correct. 5. Select a live connector from the dropdown and click 'Preview with Live Data'. 6. Verify the output is correct and based on a limited sample.","Step 4 and Step 6 both display correctly transformed JSON in the output pane. The UI remains responsive throughout.","A test Administrator account. A pre-configured data connector pointing to a test data source (e.g., a test database). A sample JSON object.

The output JSON is validated against an expected schema.","Administrators cannot test their scripts, leading to a poor user experience and potential for production errors.","Every release candidate build.","High - Requires a fully configured system with users, roles, and connectors.","Test data created during the E2E run should be cleaned up.","Test must use an authenticated session. The live data preview should not expose sensitive data from the source.","Each preview action should complete within the 30-second API timeout.","All UI elements must be keyboard accessible and have proper ARIA attributes."
"TEST-PERF-001","Data Transformation Engine Performance","Performance","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify the transformation engine meets the NFR of processing a 10MB JSON dataset with a 200-statement script in under 10 seconds on standard hardware.","Critical - Failure to meet performance NFRs means the feature is not viable for customers with medium-to-large datasets, leading to customer churn and reputational damage.","Medium","A standard test environment (4 vCPU, 16GB RAM) is provisioned. The benchmark JSON (10MB) and script (200 statements) files are available.","1. Instantiate the `JintTransformationEngine`. 2. Load the 10MB JSON into a `JsonNode` object. 3. Load the 200-statement script. 4. Start a high-precision timer. 5. Invoke the engine's `Execute` method. 6. Stop the timer. 7. Assert that the elapsed time is less than 10 seconds.","The test case passes, with the execution time recorded and asserted to be under the 10-second threshold.","A specific, version-controlled 10MB JSON file. A specific, version-controlled 200-statement JavaScript benchmark script.","xUnit, .NET `Stopwatch` class","6","12","4","REQ-PERF-DTR-002","Dedicated performance testing environment or a CI runner with guaranteed standard hardware specs.","Test must pass with an execution time under 10 seconds. The test must be stable and produce consistent results.","The feature does not meet its core performance NFR and requires significant optimization before release.","On every merge to the main branch to catch performance regressions early.","Medium - Requires deploying specific large files to the test runner.","None","N/A","Execution time must be < 10 seconds.","N/A"
"TEST-COMP-001","Audit and Compliance","Functional","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that a security-sensitive action (e.g., updating a transformation script) generates a corresponding immutable audit log entry in the MongoDB database, meeting SOC 2 compliance requirements.","Critical - Failure to produce a complete and accurate audit trail can result in failed compliance audits, legal penalties, and loss of customer trust.","Medium","Backend is running with a connection to a test MongoDB instance. A transformation script exists.","1. Make an authenticated API call to `PUT /api/v1/transformations/{id}` to update a script. 2. Verify the API call returns a 200 OK. 3. Connect to the test MongoDB instance. 4. Query the `AuditLog` collection for an entry corresponding to the update action. 5. Assert that the log entry exists and contains the correct user ID, action type ('ScriptUpdated'), entity ID, timestamp, and change details.","A single, correctly formatted audit log document is found in the MongoDB collection matching the action performed.","An Administrator user account.

The log entry must contain all fields required by the compliance specification.","The system is not compliant with SOC 2 / ISO 27001, posing a major business risk.","Every release candidate build.","High - Requires two different database systems to be managed during the test.","All records in both the relational and MongoDB databases must be cleared after the test run.","The test must verify that the audit log cannot be modified via any application API.","The audit logging should be asynchronous and not add significant latency to the user-facing API call.","N/A"
"TEST-FUNC-004","Script Versioning","Functional","End-to-End","Medium","true","Medium","Verify the complete user workflow for script versioning: updating a script creates a new version, viewing version history, comparing two versions with a visual diff, and reverting to a previous version.","Medium - A failure in versioning could lead to loss of work or inability to recover from a bad configuration, causing user frustration and operational issues.","Medium","User is authenticated as an Administrator. A transformation script with at least two previous versions exists.","1. Navigate to the script editor and save a change, verifying a new version is created. 2. Open the 'Version History' modal and verify all versions are listed. 3. Select two different versions and click 'Compare', verifying a diff view appears. 4. Select an older version and click 'Revert', verifying a new version is created with the old content.","Each step in the workflow completes successfully in the UI, and the underlying database state correctly reflects the creation of new versions and changes to the active version.","A test Administrator account.
