"Cross-training","Single point of failure in Frontend development.","Dedicate 8 hours per sprint for a backend developer (backend.dev2) to pair program with the frontend developer on low-complexity UI tasks.","Reduces bottleneck risk by 30% and provides a backup resource for bug fixes or minor UI changes.","80","10 weeks","Backend developer can independently complete a 3-point UI story by Sprint 4.","Mitigates risk of project delay valued at over $50,000."
"Continuous Quality Assurance","QA effort is concentrated in a single task (TASK-007), creating a late-cycle quality risk.","Formally allocate 20% of the QA Engineer's capacity (approx. 13 hours per sprint) to continuous testing activities, including test planning, exploratory testing, and automation for features developed in that sprint.","Earlier defect detection, improved quality, and reduced end-of-project bug fixing effort by an estimated 40 hours.","","10 weeks","Maintain a bug detection rate of over 80% within the sprint a feature is developed.","Saves approximately $3,000 in rework costs."
