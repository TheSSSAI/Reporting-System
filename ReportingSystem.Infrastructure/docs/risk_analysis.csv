"RISK-001","Timeline","A delay in the foundational 'Core Transformation Engine' (EPIC-001) will cause a cascading project-wide delay, as all UI and API management features (EPIC-002) are directly dependent on it. The critical path runs directly through the Jint integration and sandboxing tasks.","4","5","20","High","EPIC-002 (All UI Work), WS-002 (Backend API), WI-006, WI-009, WI-010, WI-011, WI-012, WI-013","Tightly coupled dependencies between the core backend engine and the user-facing management features, creating a single point of failure on the critical path.","Prioritize all tasks in EPIC-001 in the initial sprints. Define and freeze the API contract for WS-002 (Backend API) within the first two weeks, enabling parallel frontend development against a mocked API.","Develop a mock API service (e.g., using Postman mock server or a simple Node.js app) that returns static data conforming to the defined API contract. The frontend team will build against this mock until the real backend is ready.","Any slippage greater than 2 days on a work item within EPIC-001. Weekly review of the critical path progress in project management tools.","Project Manager","2024-06-14","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Incomplete or flawed implementation of the Jint sandbox (WI-002) could allow a malicious JavaScript to escape its constraints, potentially leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the host server.","3","5","15","High","WI-002 (Configure Jint Sandbox Constraints), WI-019 (Global Exception Handler), EPIC-003 (System Security)","The inherent complexity of securely sandboxing an embedded script interpreter, combined with the risk of overlooking a specific Jint configuration or a vulnerability in the Jint library itself.","Conduct mandatory, peer-led security code reviews on the `JintTransformationEngine` service. Run the application's Windows Service under a least-privilege user account. Containerize the service (Docker) with strict resource limits as a secondary defense layer.","If a vulnerability is discovered, immediately disable the transformation feature via the system-wide feature flag (WI-023) and escalate to the security team. Prepare a hotfix release plan.","Security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) flag a vulnerability in the Jint wrapper. Unexplained high CPU or memory usage correlated with script execution metrics from the Prometheus endpoint (WI-022).","Lead Backend Dev","2024-07-05","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","Failure to ensure transactional integrity between business operations (e.g., script updates) and the creation of audit log entries could lead to an inconsistent or incomplete audit trail, causing failure to meet SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliance requirements.","3","5","15","High","WI-016 (Audit Trail for Script CRUD), WI-018 (Audit Log Retention and Integrity), EPIC-003 (System Security and Auditing)","Decoupling audit logic from business logic (e.g., via events) without ensuring atomicity. A failure after the primary transaction commits but before the audit log is written would result in an unaudited change.","Implement a transactional outbox pattern or ensure domain events for auditing are only dispatched *after* the primary EF Core `DbContext.SaveChangesAsync()` transaction successfully completes. All audit-related integration tests must include a failure simulation.","If inconsistencies are found, a reconciliation script must be developed to scan the primary data tables and the audit log to identify and report on any discrepancies for manual review by a compliance officer.","Integration test failure for transactional auditing. Any alert from a log monitoring system indicating a failure to write to the audit log database (MongoDB).","Lead Backend Dev","2024-07-12","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","The Jint transformation engine may fail to meet the performance benchmark of processing a 10MB JSON dataset in under 10 seconds (WI-021), making the feature unusable for customers with large datasets and causing widespread job failures due to timeouts.","4","4","16","High","WI-021 (Performance Benchmark Test), WI-001 (Jint Engine Wrapper), WI-020 (Max Dataset Size)","The single-threaded nature of JavaScript execution combined with the overhead of the Jint interpreter and type marshalling between .NET and JS for a large object graph.","Implement the performance benchmark test (WI-021) early in the development cycle. Profile the Jint execution using a performance analysis tool to identify bottlenecks. Optimize the `JsonNode` passing mechanism to minimize overhead.","If benchmarks cannot be met, update the feature documentation (WI-026) with clear performance guidelines, advising users to use transformations only for datasets under a recommended size limit and to avoid complex, nested loops in scripts.","The automated performance benchmark test in the CI/CD pipeline fails. The Prometheus execution time histogram (WI-022) shows a P95 latency consistently above the acceptable threshold in the staging environment.","QA Lead","2024-06-28","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Timeline","High concentration of 'High' complexity work items (e.g., WI-002, WI-008, WI-010, WI-012) leads to inaccurate effort estimation, resulting in significant schedule slippage and delayed delivery of critical epics like the Control Panel UI.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-002 (Control Panel UI), EPIC-001 (Core Engine), WS-003 (React UI)","Underestimation of the effort required for integrating and configuring complex third-party components (Monaco Editor) and implementing novel security features (Jint Sandboxing).","For each 'High' complexity work item, conduct a 1-2 day time-boxed technical spike to create a proof-of-concept and refine requirements before committing to a full implementation sprint. Break down these items into smaller, independently deliverable sub-tasks.","Identify and rank non-critical features for descoping (e.g., WI-027 Internationalization, WI-012 Diff View UI could be simplified to text-only). Prepare a phased release plan where core CRUD is released first, followed by advanced features like versioning.","Weekly review of team velocity against the project burn-down chart. Any work item remaining 'In Progress' for more than two weeks.","Project Manager","2024-06-07","Not Started"
"RISK-006","External","A critical security vulnerability is discovered in a key third-party dependency, particularly the Jint library, requiring an immediate and potentially breaking upgrade. This could force unplanned work, delay the release, and introduce instability.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-001 (Core Transformation Engine), WI-001, WI-002","Reliance on external open-source software for a security-critical component of the application.","Integrate an automated dependency scanning tool (e.g., GitHub Dependabot, Snyk) into the CI/CD pipeline to provide early warnings of known vulnerabilities. Isolate the usage of Jint behind a strict service interface (`ITransformationEngine`) to simplify a potential replacement.","In case of a critical vulnerability with no immediate patch, disable the feature via the feature flag (WI-023) and communicate the risk to stakeholders. Allocate an emergency 'hotfix' team to work on the upgrade or a replacement.","Alert from the automated dependency scanning tool. Security advisories published for the Jint library.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-21","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Technical","Improper management of encryption keys for script storage (WI-014) could lead to an inability to decrypt scripts after a server migration, OS update, or in a disaster recovery scenario, resulting in permanent loss of all transformation logic.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-014 (Implement Encryption at Rest), WI-028 (Backup and Recovery)","Reliance on platform-specific key management (like .NET DPAPI) without a clear, tested procedure for exporting, backing up, and re-importing the master encryption keys.","Use the .NET Data Protection APIs with a key persistence provider that stores keys in a well-known, back-up-able location on the file system. The backup and recovery procedure (WI-028) must explicitly include the steps to back up and restore this key material.","Maintain a secure, offline backup of the DPAPI key ring in a password-protected vault. The disaster recovery plan must be tested end-to-end, including a full key restoration.","A failure in the quarterly disaster recovery test to restore and decrypt data on a new machine.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-02","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Operational","The documented rollback plan (WI-025) may fail during a real production incident due to untested steps or unforeseen environmental differences, leading to extended downtime or an inability to recover from a failed deployment.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-025 (Develop Production Cutover and Rollback Plan), WI-023 (Feature Flag)","Rollback procedures are often documented but not rigorously tested under realistic conditions, leading to a false sense of security.","Mandate at least one full, timed dry-run of the entire rollback procedure in the staging environment before the production cutover. The procedure must be a script of simple, atomic commands, not a long-form document.","If the primary rollback fails, the contingency is to restore the entire system (application and database) from the last known good backup taken just before the deployment started. This must be part of the cutover plan.","Failure of the mandatory rollback dry-run test. This is a go/no-go criterion for the production deployment.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-16","Not Started"
