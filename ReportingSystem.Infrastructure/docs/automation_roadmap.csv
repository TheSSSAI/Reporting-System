"Phase 1 (Sprints 1-2): Core Engine & Security","High","4","80","xUnit, Moq, WebApplicationFactory","180","Critical - Enables safe development and early feedback on core, high-risk features.","4 hours/month","8","CI pipeline for .NET tests; Secure storage for test secrets.","95% unit test coverage on engine; All security sandbox integration tests passing.","Jint library has unexpected behavior; DB setup for integration tests is complex.","Build an abstraction layer around Jint; Use Docker Compose for local dev databases.","De-risks the project by validating the core engine and security posture early."
"Phase 2 (Sprints 2-3): API & UI CRUD","High","4","65","Playwright, Jest, React Testing Library","200","High - Automates regression testing for the most frequently used administrative workflow.","10 hours/month","16","CI pipeline for E2E tests with a running frontend and backend.","90% of script management user stories covered by E2E tests; E2E suite runs in under 15 minutes.","Monaco editor is difficult to automate reliably; UI changes cause test brittleness.","Use stable `data-testid` attributes; Isolate Monaco interactions into specific helper functions.","Ensures the core user-facing feature is stable and reliable."
"Phase 3 (Sprints 4-5): NFRs & Advanced Features","Medium","4","40","xUnit, Playwright, JMeter/k6","150","Medium - Validates critical non-functional requirements and less common user workflows.","6 hours/month","8","Dedicated performance testing environment; Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring.","Performance benchmark test integrated and passing; Versioning E2E tests passing.","Performance environment setup is complex; Test data for versioning is hard to manage.","Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for environments; Develop database seeding scripts for test data.","Guarantees the product is production-ready, performant, and reliable."
