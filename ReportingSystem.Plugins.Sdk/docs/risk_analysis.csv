"RISK-001","Technical","A security vulnerability exists where a malicious user script could escape the Jint sandbox environment due to misconfiguration (e.g., CLR access not disabled), leading to arbitrary code execution on the server. This could result in a full system compromise, data breach, or denial of service.","3","5","15","High","WI-001-01-02: Implement Jint Sandbox Security Constraints; EPIC-003: Security & Compliance","Complexity of securely configuring the Jint execution environment and the potential for subtle errors in the sandboxing logic (REQ-SEC-DTR-001).","1. Conduct mandatory, peer-led security code reviews for all code related to the Jint wrapper service. 2. Implement automated integration tests that explicitly try to access forbidden CLR namespaces (e.g., System.IO). 3. Engage a third-party for a penetration test focused on the transformation engine before the production cutover.","If a vulnerability is discovered post-release, immediately disable the data transformation feature using the system-wide feature flag (REQ-OPER-IMP-001) and deploy an emergency patch.","A new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is published for the Jint library. Anomaly detection in server process behavior (e.g., unexpected network calls or file access) from the application service.","Lead Backend Developer","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","The transformation engine may fail to meet the performance benchmark of processing a 10MB JSON dataset with a 200-statement script in under 10 seconds (REQ-PERF-DTR-002). This failure would block release if considered a go/no-go criterion and undermine confidence in the system's scalability.","4","4","16","High","WI-004-01-02: Implement Performance Benchmark Test; EPIC-004: Operational Readiness & DevOps","Inherent performance overhead of an interpreted language (JavaScript) running on the CLR, combined with the large in-memory dataset and potentially inefficient user-written scripts.","1. Develop the performance benchmark test early in the development cycle. 2. Run the benchmark as part of the CI/CD pipeline to detect performance regressions. 3. Create and publish 'Best Practice' documentation for writing performant transformation scripts (REQ-UI-DTR-001).","If the benchmark cannot be met, conduct a detailed performance analysis to identify bottlenecks. Propose a revised, achievable benchmark to stakeholders or re-architect to a streaming-based transformation model for a future release.","The automated performance benchmark test in the QA suite fails consecutively for more than three builds.","QA Lead","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Operational","The one-time migration script to import legacy transformation logic (REQ-OPER-IMP-002) fails during the production cutover due to unforeseen data quality issues, complex logic that cannot be mapped, or incorrect report associations. This could lead to significant downtime, data loss, and require a full rollback.","4","5","20","High","WI-004-02-02: Create Legacy Data Migration Script; EPIC-004: Operational Readiness & DevOps","High complexity and potential for unknown edge cases in legacy data structures and logic. The migration is a one-shot, high-stakes operation.","1. Perform multiple, full-scale test runs of the migration script against a recent snapshot of the production database in a staging environment. 2. Develop a validation tool that compares a sample of legacy outputs with outputs from the new system using migrated scripts. 3. Make the migration script idempotent so it can be safely re-run on failure.","The production cutover plan must include a go/no-go checkpoint after the migration run and validation. If validation fails, execute the documented rollback procedure (REQ-OPER-IMP-004), which involves restoring the database from backup and disabling the new feature via its flag.","The migration script's validation tool reports a discrepancy percentage above a predefined threshold (e.g., >1%) during a staging run.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","External","The audit trail implementation fails to meet SOC 2 or ISO 27001 compliance objectives (REQ-COMP-DTR-001) due to misinterpretation of the standards, particularly around proving log immutability and integrity. This could result in a failed audit, requiring costly and time-consuming rework.","3","5","15","High","WI-003-02-03: Ensure Audit Trail Compliance (SOC 2/ISO 27001); EPIC-003: Security & Compliance","Ambiguity in compliance standards and the technical difficulty of achieving and proving true immutability in a standard database system.","1. Engage with a compliance expert or internal audit team early to review the proposed technical design for the audit trail. 2. Choose a storage technology that has features supporting immutability (e.g., write-only permissions, append-only logs, checksum validation). 3. Document the design and rationale, explicitly mapping it to the relevant compliance controls.","If the design is found to be non-compliant late in the cycle, prioritize a tactical fix (e.g., exporting logs to a WORM-compliant external system) to meet immediate audit needs while planning for a strategic re-architecture.","Early design review feedback from the compliance team indicates a potential gap in the proposed implementation.","Security Lead","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The Monaco Editor integration (REQ-UI-DTR-002) proves to be overly complex, causing significant delays, or its large bundle size negatively impacts the Control Panel's initial load performance. This could compromise the user experience for a key administrative feature.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-002-01-01: Integrate Monaco Editor Component; EPIC-002: Transformation Management UI","Monaco Editor is a powerful but heavy and complex component to integrate into a React application, especially with features like version diffing.","1. Create a technical spike and proof-of-concept early to validate the integration approach and measure the performance impact. 2. Implement code splitting and lazy loading for the editor component to minimize its impact on the initial application bundle.","If Monaco proves unfeasible, switch to a lighter-weight editor component (e.g., CodeMirror, Ace Editor), accepting a potential reduction in features like real-time validation or advanced code completion.","Initial proof-of-concept shows a page load time increase of more than 1.5 seconds, or the development effort for the spike exceeds the allocated time by 50%.","Lead Frontend Developer","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The project requires specialized expertise in Jint security sandboxing and SOC 2/ISO 27001 compliance logging, which may not be readily available within the team. A skill gap could lead to insecure or non-compliant implementation, requiring significant rework.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-001-01-02: Implement Jint Sandbox Security Constraints; WI-003-02-03: Ensure Audit Trail Compliance","The project combines standard web development with niche security and compliance requirements.","1. Assign the most senior developers to the security-critical tasks. 2. Allocate budget for external consultation with a security expert and a compliance auditor for design reviews. 3. Schedule dedicated training sessions for the team on secure coding practices for Jint and logging for compliance.","If a critical skill gap is identified, augment the team with a short-term contractor specializing in application security or compliance engineering.","Code reviews for security-critical components consistently reveal fundamental design flaws rather than minor implementation bugs.","Project Manager","2024-06-01","In Progress"
"RISK-007","Operational","The documented production rollback procedure (REQ-OPER-IMP-004) fails during a real-world incident due to an untested edge case or environmental difference. A failed rollback could exacerbate an outage, leading to extended downtime and potential data corruption.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-004-02-03: Develop Production Cutover and Rollback Plan","Rollback procedures are often complex and difficult to test under conditions that perfectly mimic a production failure scenario.","1. Conduct a mandatory, hands-on 'game day' exercise where the team must execute the full rollback procedure in a staging environment that mirrors production. 2. Automate as much of the rollback procedure as possible using CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code scripts to reduce human error. 3. The rollback plan must be reviewed and approved by at least two senior engineers.","The rollback plan itself is the contingency. If it fails, the contingency is a full disaster recovery from backup, which has a much longer RTO. The primary goal is to make the rollback plan robust.","The 'game day' exercise fails to complete successfully within the documented time or requires undocumented manual steps to succeed.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
