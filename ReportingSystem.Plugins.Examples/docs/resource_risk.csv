"RISK-002","Technical","The Jint transformation engine fails to meet performance requirements (10MB JSON in <10s) under load, causing widespread job timeouts.","Medium","High","[""DTR-BE-01"",""DTR-BE-02""]","1","Implement automated performance benchmark test (REQ-PERF-DTR-002) in CI/CD pipeline and profile engine under heavy load early in Sprint 1.","Scope future enhancement for a streaming-based transformation engine if benchmarks cannot be met.","Automated performance test fails consistently; Prometheus metrics show high P95 latency.","","1 week to analyze and optimize."
"RISK-003","Security","A malicious script bypasses the Jint sandbox constraints, allowing access to the host's CLR, file system, or network, leading to a critical security breach.","Low","Critical","[""DTR-BE-02"",""DTR-BE-07""]","","Mandatory formal security review of sandbox implementation. Enforce strict, non-configurable security options (no CLR access).","Immediately disable the entire Data Transformation feature via the system-wide feature flag (REQ-OPER-IMP-001) and release a security patch.","Security audit logs show a sandbox violation; Penetration testing reveals a sandbox escape vector.","","24 hours to disable via feature flag."
"RISK-005","Quality","The visual diff component for script versioning performs poorly with large scripts, leading to browser freezes and a frustrating user experience.","High","Medium","[""DTR-FE-03""]","1","Allocate time for a technical spike in Sprint 2 to evaluate multiple diff libraries (e.g., Monaco Diff Editor vs. react-diff-viewer) for performance.","Replace the side-by-side visual diff with a simpler 'view-only' modal for each version, deferring the visual diff feature.","QA testing shows browser unresponsive for >5 seconds with scripts >100KB.","","1 week to implement contingency."
