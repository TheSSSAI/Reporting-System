"RISK-001","Technical","The custom connector plug-in architecture, which relies on .NET's AssemblyLoadContext for isolation, could introduce subtle, hard-to-diagnose bugs such as dependency conflicts ('dependency hell') or memory leaks, leading to application instability or crashes.","4","4","16","High","Implementation of custom connector framework (US-041, US-113), and all reports relying on custom connectors.","High complexity of dynamic assembly loading and isolation in .NET, which has numerous edge cases and potential for difficult-to-trace errors.","Assign implementation to a senior developer with experience in .NET assembly loading. Create a comprehensive Plug-in Development Kit (PDK) with strict guidelines. Develop integration tests that load multiple, conflicting plug-ins to validate isolation.","If runtime loading proves too unstable, pivot to a simpler, less flexible model where plug-ins are registered at compile-time for an initial release, deferring dynamic loading to a future version.","Unexplained `TypeLoadException` or `FileLoadException` errors appear in logs. Application memory usage grows unexpectedly after loading custom connectors.","Lead Backend Architect","2024-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The Jint transformation engine fails to meet performance requirements (10MB JSON in <10s) under load, especially with large datasets or complex scripts, causing widespread job timeouts and excessive server resource consumption.","4","4","16","High","Core Data Transformation Engine implementation (EPIC-001), specifically performance benchmark testing (WI-003) and all report jobs that use transformations.","The inherent performance limitations of an in-memory scripting engine processing large, multi-megabyte JSON objects within a single thread.","Implement and mandate passing of the automated performance benchmark test (WI-003) in the CI/CD pipeline. Conduct profiling on the transformation engine under heavy load. Document and promote scripting best practices for performance.","For enterprise clients with extreme data volumes, scope a future enhancement for a streaming-based transformation engine that does not require buffering the entire dataset in memory.","The automated performance benchmark test fails consistently. Prometheus metrics show a high P95 latency for script execution time, exceeding defined SLOs.","Lead Backend Dev","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Security","A malicious or poorly configured JavaScript script bypasses the Jint sandbox constraints, allowing it to access the host's CLR, file system, or network. This could lead to a critical security breach, data exfiltration, or a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.","3","5","15","High","Implementation of Jint sandbox constraints (REQ-SEC-DTR-001, WI-002) and engine isolation (REQ-REL-DTR-001, WI-023).","Improper configuration of the Jint engine's security options or an unknown vulnerability in the Jint library itself.","Conduct a mandatory, formal security review of the `JintTransformationEngine.cs` implementation. Enforce strict sandbox options: disable CLR access, set aggressive timeouts, memory limits, and statement counts. Minimize the number of .NET objects exposed to the script.","If a vulnerability is discovered post-release, immediately disable the entire Data Transformation feature using the system-wide feature flag (REQ-OPER-IMP-001) and release a security patch.","Security audit logs show a sandbox violation (WI-020). Penetration testing reveals a sandbox escape vector. Unexpected exceptions related to security are caught from the Jint engine.","Security Architect","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","The one-time migration script for legacy transformation logic (REQ-OPER-IMP-002, WI-029) is flawed, leading to data loss, incorrect mapping of report associations, or data corruption, resulting in significant manual cleanup and loss of customer trust.","3","5","15","High","Development and execution of the legacy transformation migration script (WI-029).","High complexity of legacy data formats and relationships, combined with the inherent risk of one-off data migration scripts.","Ensure the script is idempotent. Develop a 'dry-run' mode that reports all intended changes without committing them. Mandate a full database backup before execution. The script must have extensive logging. Perform multiple test runs in a staging environment using a restored production backup.","Develop a documented rollback procedure in parallel with the migration script. In case of failure, restore the pre-migration database backup and postpone the feature cutover.","The script's 'dry-run' mode reports validation errors or unexpected data mappings. Post-migration validation queries show discrepancies between old and new data counts.","Lead Backend Dev","2024-10-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","The visual diff component for script versioning (WI-011) performs poorly with large or complex scripts, leading to browser freezes, high memory consumption on the client-side, and a frustrating user experience for administrators.","4","3","12","Medium","Implementation of version history and visual diff UI (WI-011).","The computational complexity of generating a diff for large text files and rendering it in the browser DOM.","Allocate time for a technical spike to evaluate multiple diff libraries (e.g., Monaco Diff Editor vs. `react-diff-viewer`) for performance. Implement virtualization or lazy rendering for the diff view. Enforce a maximum script size for which diffing is available.","If a performant solution cannot be found within the timeline, replace the side-by-side visual diff with a simpler 'view-only' modal for each version, deferring the visual diff feature to a later release.","During QA, the diff feature causes the browser to become unresponsive for more than 5 seconds when comparing scripts larger than 100KB.","Lead Frontend Dev","2024-09-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","Loss or mismanagement of the encryption keys used for Data Protection APIs (REQ-SEC-DTR-003, WI-022) during server migration or disaster recovery renders all stored transformation scripts permanently unreadable and unrecoverable.","2","5","10","Medium","Encryption at Rest for scripts (WI-022) and Backup/Recovery procedures (WI-025).","Operational error due to incomplete backup procedures or lack of awareness of where .NET DPAPI keys are stored on the server.","Explicitly document the location and procedure for backing up and restoring the DPAPI key ring as part of the system's disaster recovery plan. Automate the key backup process where possible. Perform a full DR test that includes restoring keys to a new server.","Maintain a securely stored, offline backup of the encryption key ring in a separate, access-controlled location like a corporate key vault.","The application service fails to start after a server restore, with error messages in the event log related to 'decryption' or 'data protection' failures.","DevOps Engineer","2024-09-30","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The team lacks specific expertise in the WiX Toolset and C# Custom Actions, leading to significant delays in creating the MSI installer (WI-039) and potential for a buggy, unreliable installation experience for customers.","3","3","9","Medium","Development of the MSI Installer (WI-039, US-001, US-003, US-004, US-005).","WiX is a specialized, complex technology that is not a common skill for application developers.","Allocate a time-boxed technical spike for a developer to research and build a proof-of-concept installer. Provide a budget for specialized training or online courses. Prioritize the installer work early in the project timeline to absorb potential delays.","If the MSI proves too complex, prepare a simpler deployment package using a ZIP file with a PowerShell script for installation as a fallback for the initial release, deferring the MSI to a later version.","The initial proof-of-concept for the installer takes more than double the estimated time. Key features like custom actions prove unworkable within the sprint.","Project Manager","2024-08-01","Not Started"
