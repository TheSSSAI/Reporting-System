"Cross-training","Key skills (Jint, Monaco Editor) are concentrated in single senior developers.","Mandate pair programming sessions between senior and mid-level developers on critical tasks (DTR-BE-02, DTR-FE-03).","Reduces key-person dependency risk by 50% and improves code quality through shared context.","16","4 weeks","Mid-level developers can independently resolve low-complexity bugs in Jint and Monaco components.","Avoids potential 2-week project delay if a key person is unavailable, saving ~$20,000."
"Early Risk Mitigation","Performance and security risks (RISK-002, RISK-003) are high-impact.","Front-load security review and performance benchmark implementation into Sprint 1, even if it slightly delays other tasks.","Identifies critical architectural flaws early, preventing costly rework in later sprints.","8","1 week","Go/No-Go decision on Jint's performance and security model is made by the end of Sprint 1.","Prevents potential project failure or major architectural pivot, saving >$50,000 in rework costs."
