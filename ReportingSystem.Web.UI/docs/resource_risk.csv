"RISK-R001","Technical","A malicious or poorly written user script bypasses the Jint engine's security constraints (memory, timeout, statement count, no CLR access), leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the host server or unauthorized access to the underlying system.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-DTE-002"",""TASK-DTE-003"",""TASK-DTE-004""]","","1. Conduct a rigorous code review of the Jint `Options` configuration. 2. Implement a multi-layered defense by running the .NET service as a low-privilege user. 3. Log every sandbox violation to a high-priority security audit trail with immediate alerting capabilities.","If a sandbox escape is detected, immediately disable the data transformation feature via the system-wide feature flag and trigger a security incident response.","An alert fires from the security audit log for a CLR access attempt.","","1 week"
"RISK-R006","Resource","The team lacks deep expertise in the Jint library's internals or Monaco Editor's complex API, leading to significant delays when troubleshooting complex performance, security, or UI integration issues that are not covered by standard documentation.","Medium","Medium","[""TASK-DTE-002"",""TASK-DTE-003"",""TASK-DTE-014""]","2","1. Allocate time for a developer to conduct a 'deep dive' spike on both Jint and Monaco to build expertise. 2. Proactively engage with the open-source communities for these libraries. 3. Identify and document potential failure points during the initial PoC phase.","If a critical, unresolvable issue is found, allocate budget for commercial support if available, or begin research into alternative libraries (e.g., ClearScript for backend, CodeMirror for frontend).","A task related to Jint or Monaco is blocked for more than 3 days due to an unknown issue.","5000","3 weeks"
