"RISK-001","Technical","A malicious or poorly written user script bypasses the Jint engine's security constraints (memory, timeout, statement count, no CLR access), leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the host server or unauthorized access to the underlying system.","3","5","15","High","Core script execution (REQ-FUNC-DTR-001, REQ-SEC-DTR-001), overall system stability and security.","Reliance on a third-party library for a critical security boundary; potential for misconfiguration of the sandboxing options or an unknown vulnerability in the Jint library itself.","1. Conduct a rigorous code review of the Jint `Options` configuration against library documentation and security best practices. 2. Implement a multi-layered defense by running the .NET service itself as a low-privilege user. 3. Log every sandbox violation to a high-priority security audit trail with immediate alerting capabilities.","If a sandbox escape is detected, immediately disable the data transformation feature via the system-wide feature flag (REQ-OPER-IMP-001) and trigger a security incident response. Prepare a patch to tighten or disable the vulnerable feature.","An alert fires from the security audit log for a CLR access attempt. Prometheus alerts fire for execution times consistently hitting the timeout limit or for anomalous memory consumption spikes.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","The transformation engine fails to meet the non-functional requirement of processing a 10MB JSON dataset with a 200-statement script in under 10 seconds (REQ-PERF-DTR-002), blocking release and requiring significant, costly re-architecture.","4","5","20","High","QA testing, Release Go/No-Go decision, product viability for enterprise customers with large datasets.","The inherent performance limitations of a JavaScript interpreter running within the CLR, combined with potentially inefficient data marshalling between .NET objects and the JS environment.","1. Develop the performance benchmark test suite *early* in the development cycle, not at the end. 2. Conduct a proof-of-concept (PoC) specifically targeting the Jint engine's performance with large JSON objects. 3. Integrate the performance benchmark test into the CI/CD pipeline to detect regressions automatically.","If the benchmark is consistently missed by a significant margin, investigate alternative JS engines for .NET (e.g., ClearScript with V8) or consider offloading the transformation logic to a separate, high-performance microservice written in Go or Rust.","The automated performance benchmark test in the CI/CD pipeline fails or shows a significant performance degradation trend over several builds.","Lead QA Engineer","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Operational","The .NET Data Protection APIs (DPAPI) used for script encryption (REQ-SEC-DTR-003) are misconfigured for production, causing decryption to fail in containerized, cloud, or load-balanced environments. This would result in catastrophic and irreversible data loss of all transformation scripts.","4","5","20","High","Production deployment, system reliability, disaster recovery, all script management operations.","Default DPAPI behavior relies on machine-specific keys, which is incompatible with distributed or non-persistent environments. Lack of team experience with DPAPI in such scenarios.","1. Explicitly configure the .NET Data Protection system to use a shared key store accessible by all application instances (e.g., a file share with UNC path, Azure Blob Storage, or Redis). 2. Document the key management strategy and required infrastructure setup in the deployment guide. 3. Create an integration test that simulates a multi-instance environment (encrypt on instance A, decrypt on instance B) to verify the shared key store is working.","In case of production failure, recovery is only possible from a database backup AND the original DPAPI key ring from the specific machine that performed the encryption. This would trigger a high-risk manual recovery procedure to decrypt and re-encrypt all scripts using a corrected shared key configuration.","The application fails to start in a multi-node staging/production environment, with logs indicating cryptographic or decryption failures when accessing scripts.","DevOps Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","The audit trail implementation fails to meet the strict immutability and integrity requirements for SOC 2 / ISO 27001 compliance (REQ-COMP-DTR-001), such as by storing logs in a standard modifiable database table, making the product non-compliant for enterprise customers.","3","4","12","Medium","Audit Logging implementation (WI-004-1-3), compliance audits, and sales to regulated industries.","Underestimation of the technical complexity required to achieve true log immutability beyond simple database writes. Lack of a dedicated tamper-evident storage solution.","1. Engage with a compliance/security expert early to review the proposed audit trail architecture. 2. Implement a standard pattern for immutability, such as writing logs to a WORM (Write-Once, Read-Many) storage like AWS S3 with Object Lock. 3. Implement a periodic process that re-calculates checksums of log data to detect tampering.","If an audit reveals the log is not compliant, the system's logging mechanism will need to be re-architected. Historical logs will remain non-compliant, posing a business risk that must be accepted or disclosed to customers.","A periodic checksum validation job fails, indicating potential tampering. An external or internal compliance audit flags the implementation as insufficient.","Security Architect","2024-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The logic for updating a script (creating a new `TransformationScriptVersion` and updating the parent `TransformationScript`) is not fully atomic. A failure mid-operation could leave the database in an inconsistent state, causing reports to run using the wrong version of a script.","3","4","12","Medium","Script Management (WI-002-1-3), data integrity of generated reports.","Failure to properly wrap the multi-step database update in a single, explicit `DbContext` transaction, leading to a partial commit upon an intermediate error.","1. Ensure the service layer logic uses `await _context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync()` and commits the transaction only after all related entities have been successfully saved. 2. Conduct a specific code review of the script update repository method to validate transactional integrity. 3. Create an integration test that mocks a `SaveChanges` failure and asserts that the entire transaction is rolled back.","A manual database script would be required to identify and correct inconsistent versioning records. This would involve finding parent scripts pointing to incorrect or non-existent active versions and correcting the foreign key references.","The integration test for transactional integrity fails. Customer reports that saving a script sometimes results in the wrong version being active, or errors when retrieving script history.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-07-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The team lacks deep expertise in the Jint library's internals or Monaco Editor's complex API, leading to significant delays when troubleshooting complex performance, security, or UI integration issues that are not covered by standard documentation.","3","3","9","Medium","Jint Integration (WS-001-1), Monaco Editor Integration (WI-003-1-1), performance tuning, and bug fixing.","Reliance on specialized third-party libraries without having in-house subject matter experts.","1. Allocate time for a developer to conduct a 'deep dive' spike on both Jint and Monaco to build expertise. 2. Proactively engage with the open-source communities for these libraries. 3. Identify and document potential failure points during the initial PoC phase.","If a critical, unresolvable issue is found, allocate budget for commercial support if available, or begin research into alternative libraries (e.g., ClearScript for backend, CodeMirror for frontend).","A task related to Jint or Monaco is blocked for more than 3 days due to an unknown issue. Development velocity on UI or backend transformation tasks is significantly lower than estimated.","Development Manager","2024-06-10","Not Started"
