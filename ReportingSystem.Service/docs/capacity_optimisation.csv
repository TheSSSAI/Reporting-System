"Cross-training","High key-person dependency on the Senior Backend Developer for security and Jint expertise.","Formalize a cross-training plan where the mid-level backend developer is allocated 20% of their time in Sprint 1 and 2 to pair program on tasks REQ-SEC-DTR-001 and REQ-SEC-DTR-003. The Fullstack developer should review all PRs for these tasks.","Reduces single-point-of-failure risk by 50%. Creates a backup resource for critical components. Increases team velocity in later sprints.","24","4 weeks","Mid-level developer can independently resolve a medium-complexity bug in the sandbox component.","Avoids potential 4-week project delay, valued at over $50,000."
"Process Improvement","Frontend development is blocked until backend APIs are fully implemented, creating a sequential dependency (DEP-002).","Mandate an 'API Contract First' approach. Before Sprint 2 begins, backend and frontend developers must define and agree on the OpenAPI (Swagger) specification for all APIs needed in that sprint (e.g., `/preview`). The backend provides a mock server or lightweight mock implementation by Day 1 of the sprint.","Enables parallel development, reduces integration time by 30%, and minimizes rework due to API misunderstandings.","8","Ongoing","Frontend work for a sprint can start on Day 1 without waiting for the backend implementation.","Potentially saves 1 week of integration effort over the project lifecycle."
