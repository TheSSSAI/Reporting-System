"RISK-001","Technical","A vulnerability in the Jint sandbox implementation could allow untrusted user JavaScript to escape its constraints, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or access to the host system's resources. This would be a critical security failure.","3","5","15","High","Core Transformation Engine execution (WI-001, WI-002), all features depending on script execution (e.g., REQ-FUNC-DTR-001, REQ-SEC-DTR-001).","The inherent complexity of securely sandboxing an execution environment and the risk of a misconfiguration or an unknown vulnerability in the Jint library itself.","Conduct rigorous, security-focused code reviews of the JintEngineWrapper service (WI-002). Implement automated integration tests that actively try to bypass constraints (e.g., access file system, CLR). Engage a third-party for penetration testing focused on sandbox escapes before release.","Run the application's Windows Service under a least-privilege user account to limit the potential impact of a successful sandbox escape. Implement aggressive monitoring and alerting on suspicious process activity originating from the service.","Security audit logs showing unexpected exceptions from the Jint engine. Any failed penetration test scenario. New CVEs published for the Jint library.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Timeline","Cascading delays caused by a slip in a critical path dependency, such as the finalization of the Core Transformation Engine (EPIC-001). Delays in the backend API will directly block all frontend UI development and E2E testing.","4","4","16","High","Frontend Script Editor UI (WS-003), Script Management UI (EPIC-002), all E2E testing activities.","High technical complexity and interdependencies between foundational backend services and the user-facing application features.","Prioritize critical path work items (WI-001, WI-002, WI-005, WI-006) at the beginning of the project. Define and mock API contracts early using OpenAPI/Swagger to allow parallel frontend development against a stable interface. Use feature flags (WI-019) to decouple less critical features from the main release train.","If a core backend component is significantly delayed, immediately re-prioritize sprints to focus on other independent work streams (e.g., documentation, operational readiness) while the blocking issue is resolved. Adjust the overall project timeline and communicate the impact to stakeholders proactively.","Any work item on the critical path (e.g., WI-002) slipping by more than 50% of its estimated effort within a sprint.","Project Manager","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Operational","Failure to achieve true immutability for the security audit trail, which would result in non-compliance with SOC 2 / ISO 27001 objectives (REQ-COMP-DTR-001) and expose the system to legal and reputational risk if audit logs can be tampered with.","2","5","10","Medium","Immutable Audit Trail Service implementation (WI-014), all security and compliance related deliverables.","Incorrect selection or configuration of the database technology used for the audit trail. Insufficiently restricted database user permissions allowing modification or deletion of log data.","Conduct a formal architecture review of the audit trail implementation. Use a database technology that supports append-only or write-once features (e.g., AWS QLDB, or a document DB with highly restricted permissions). The application's database user must have write-only permissions to the audit collections.","If the primary data store cannot be made immutable, implement a secondary, real-time log shipping process to a secure, tamper-evident external system (e.g., a dedicated log management service with WORM storage like AWS S3 Object Lock).","A security audit or penetration test demonstrates the ability to modify or delete an audit log entry through any means other than direct, privileged database access.","Lead Security Architect","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","The Monaco Editor integration proves to be more complex than estimated, causing significant delays in the frontend development timeline. Issues with build configuration, performance, or API customization could impact the entire script management UI.","4","3","12","Medium","Monaco Editor Component (WI-009), Three-Pane Layout (WI-010), and all dependent frontend work in EPIC-002.","High complexity of the Monaco Editor library, which is essentially a standalone application (VS Code's editor), and its specific build requirements (web workers).","Allocate a time-boxed technical spike (1-2 days) at the beginning of the project to create a proof-of-concept for Monaco integration with the chosen build tool (Vite/Webpack). Strictly follow the official integration guides provided by the `@monaco-editor/react` library.","If the Monaco Editor integration proves to be a major roadblock, switch to a simpler but less feature-rich editor component like CodeMirror or Ace Editor. This would be a trade-off, losing some real-time validation features but securing the timeline.","The Monaco Editor integration spike (PoC) fails to meet its objectives or exceeds its timebox by more than 100%.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2024-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","The key performance benchmark (10MB JSON in < 10s per REQ-PERF-DTR-002) is not met on the specified standard hardware, leading to a failure to meet non-functional requirements and potential performance issues for customers with large datasets.","3","4","12","Medium","QA Performance Benchmark Test (WI-018), overall system acceptance.","Unexpected performance bottlenecks in the Jint library, inefficient data marshalling between .NET and JavaScript, or excessive garbage collection pressure when handling large JSON objects in memory.","Implement and run the automated benchmark test (WI-018) early and continuously in the CI/CD pipeline against a dedicated, hardware-consistent environment. Conduct proactive performance profiling on the `JintEngineWrapper` service with large data payloads.","Allocate a 'performance tuning' story in later sprints. If optimization of the current process is insufficient, investigate alternative Jint configurations (e.g., engine pooling) or, in an extreme case, evaluate alternative .NET-based JavaScript engines.","The automated performance benchmark test fails consistently in the CI environment.","QA Lead","2024-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","Loss or misconfiguration of the encryption keys used for storing scripts at rest (REQ-SEC-DTR-003) could lead to permanent, unrecoverable loss of all transformation script data.","2","5","10","Medium","Encryption for Scripts at Rest (WI-016), Backup & Recovery Procedures (WI-021).","Operational error during server migration, failure to back up machine-level keys, or improper configuration of the .NET Data Protection APIs (DPAPI).","Strictly adhere to Microsoft's documented best practices for DPAPI key management and deployment. The official Backup and Recovery documentation (WI-021) must explicitly include procedures for backing up and restoring the DPAPI key ring.","In the event of key loss, the only recovery path is to restore from a full system backup that includes the key ring. There is no cryptographic contingency; the plan is purely procedural disaster recovery.","The application fails to start with decryption errors in the logs, indicating a key management issue.","DevOps Engineer / IT Support","2024-07-30","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The project's high complexity requires specialized skills in areas like secure script sandboxing (Jint), advanced frontend editors (Monaco), and compliance (SOC 2). A lack of expertise or the departure of a key person in one of these areas could severely impact the timeline and quality.","3","4","12","Medium","Jint Integration & Sandboxing (WS-001), Frontend Script Editor UI (WS-003), RBAC & Audit Trail Implementation (WS-004).","Concentration of critical, specialized knowledge in a small number of team members without adequate cross-training or documentation.","Promote pair programming and mandatory, thorough code reviews on all critical components (sandboxing, encryption, audit trail). Maintain high-quality internal technical documentation for complex features. Conduct a skills-gap analysis and provide targeted training where needed.","Have a budget for bringing in external consultants or contractors on short notice for highly specialized areas like penetration testing or compliance auditing if internal resources become unavailable.","A key team member becomes a single point of failure and a bottleneck for multiple critical tasks.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-10","Not Started"
