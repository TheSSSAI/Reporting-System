"RISK-R001","Skill Gap","The project is heavily dependent on a single Senior Backend Developer for critical, specialized skills in Jint sandboxing and at-rest encryption. Any availability issues with this resource would severely impact the critical path.","Medium","High","[""REQ-FUNC-DTR-001"",""REQ-SEC-DTR-001"",""REQ-SEC-DTR-003""]","4","Mandate pair programming between the senior and mid-level backend developers on all security-sensitive tasks. Prioritize extensive documentation for the JintEngineWrapper and encryption services.","Have the Fullstack Developer shift to backend work to support if the primary senior developer is unavailable. Allocate budget for an on-demand security consultant.","Senior backend developer's allocated tasks slip by more than 3 days in a sprint.","25000","Immediate implementation of pairing."
"RISK-R002","Technical","Complexity of Monaco Editor integration (REQ-UI-DTR-002) is underestimated, leading to significant delays in the frontend track, which is a critical path for user-facing features.","High","Medium","[""REQ-UI-DTR-002"",""REQ-UI-DTR-003"",""REQ-FUNC-DTR-005""]","2","Start Sprint 2 with a 2-day time-boxed technical spike to create a proof-of-concept for Monaco integration. If the spike fails, immediately evaluate simpler alternatives like CodeMirror.","Revert to a simpler code editor component (e.g., CodeMirror) which has fewer features but lower integration risk. The Product Owner must approve this feature trade-off.","The technical spike for Monaco integration fails to produce a working build within the allocated time.","","2 days for the spike."
