This entity-relationship diagram visualizes the database schema for the core application. It outlines the tables for user and role management, script and version control, and report configuration with execution logging. Relationships are shown to detail how users create and manage assets, how scripts are versioned, how reports are configured with optional scripts, and how each job execution is logged. The 'UserRole' table acts as a junction for the many-to-many relationship between users and roles. The 'ApplicationConfiguration' table is a standalone key-value store.
