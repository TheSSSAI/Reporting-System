This diagram illustrates the entity-relationship model for the core application database, covering all entities and their relationships. It highlights user roles in creating and managing assets like scripts, reports, and schemas. Key architectural patterns include immutable script versioning (TransformationScript to ScriptVersion), a many-to-many relationship between reports and scripts (via ReportTransformationScriptAssociation), and optional JSON schema validation for reports. All creation and modification actions are audited by linking back to the User entity.
