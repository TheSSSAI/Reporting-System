This ER diagram illustrates the complete database schema, including entities for transformation scripts, reporting, user management (RBAC), auditing, and configuration. It details the relationships between scripts and their versions, how reports are configured and executed as jobs, and how users interact with these components. The diagram also shows standalone entities for application configuration and a materialized view for dashboard reporting. Cardinality is represented to clarify one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many (via junction table) relationships.
