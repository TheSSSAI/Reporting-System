This diagram illustrates the database schema for the Audit and Security Logging system. It features two primary entities: 'AuditLog' for tracking security-sensitive actions and 'SecurityViolationLog' for recording sandbox constraint violations. The entities are designed for a document/time-series database like MongoDB, focusing on high-volume writes and time-based querying. As there are no direct foreign key relationships between these two logging collections in the provided schema, they are represented as separate, unrelated entities.
