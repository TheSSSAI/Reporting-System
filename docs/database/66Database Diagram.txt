This ER diagram shows the database schema for audit and security logging. It contains two distinct entities, 'AuditLog' and 'SecurityViolationLog', which are designed as separate collections in a MongoDB database for logging different types of events. 'AuditLog' tracks script management activities, while 'SecurityViolationLog' records security policy violations during script execution. Since the schema represents disconnected log collections, no relationships are drawn between them.
