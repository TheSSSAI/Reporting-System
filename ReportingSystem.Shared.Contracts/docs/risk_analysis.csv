"RISK-001","Technical","The one-time legacy migration script (REQ-OPER-IMP-002) fails during production cutover due to unforeseen data mapping complexities or data quality issues, resulting in data loss, incorrect report associations, and significant project delays.","4","4","16","High","Production deployment, legacy system decommissioning (REQ-OPER-IMP-005), and user acceptance of the new feature.","High complexity of migrating business logic and reliance on the quality of legacy data structures which may be poorly documented or inconsistent.","1. Develop a comprehensive data mapping document. 2. Perform multiple migration dry-runs in a staging environment using a full production data snapshot. 3. Develop a post-migration validation tool to compare a sample of migrated logic and all report associations against the source system.","Keep the legacy system operational in a read-only state for a 30-day grace period post-migration. If critical failures are found, use the rollback plan (REQ-OPER-IMP-004) to disable the new feature and revert to the legacy system while the migration script is fixed.","The post-migration validation tool reports a data mismatch rate greater than 0.1% or any failure in report associations.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Operational","An OutOfMemory exception occurs in the production environment because the pre-buffering check on dataset size (REQ-BR-DTR-001) is insufficient for a complex transformation, causing the Jint engine or .NET service to consume excessive memory and crash the application service.","3","5","15","High","System stability, report generation reliability (REQ-REL-DTR-001), and adherence to the 99.9% availability target (REQ-OPER-DTR-003).","The architecture requires buffering the entire dataset into memory (REQ-DATA-DTR-001). The actual in-memory size after parsing into a JsonNode and during Jint execution may exceed the raw file size limit, especially with memory-intensive scripts.","1. Implement stress tests using datasets at, and slightly above, the 256MB limit with memory-intensive scripts. 2. Add detailed Prometheus metrics (REQ-OPER-DTR-001) for memory usage specifically within the transformation pipeline to create early warning alerts. 3. The maximum dataset size check should be based on a conservative multiplier of the raw stream length.","The job isolation feature (REQ-REL-DTR-001) ensures the main service does not crash. An operational runbook will be created to guide administrators on identifying problematic reports and either disabling them or increasing the memory limit on the server as a temporary fix.","Prometheus alert fires when `dotnet_total_memory_bytes` for the service process exceeds 80% of the server's allocated RAM during job execution.","SRE / Lead Ops Engineer","2025-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","A malicious or poorly written JavaScript escapes the Jint sandbox (REQ-SEC-DTR-001) due to a flaw in the Jint library itself or a misconfiguration, leading to unauthorized CLR access, file system access, or a denial-of-service attack on the host server.","2","5","10","Medium","Overall system security, data integrity, and availability. Directly impacts compliance with SOC 2 / ISO 27001 (REQ-COMP-DTR-001).","The system's architecture relies on a third-party library (Jint) to execute untrusted, user-provided code, which is an inherent and significant security risk.","1. Conduct a formal security code review focused on the Jint integration and sandboxing configuration. 2. Develop a suite of 'malicious' scripts that attempt to bypass constraints (e.g., access `System.IO.File`, create infinite loops, allocate huge arrays) and integrate them as a permanent part of the CI/CD test suite. 3. Subscribe to and monitor security advisories for the Jint library.","If a sandbox bypass vulnerability is discovered, immediately disable the entire Data Transformation feature using the system-wide feature flag (REQ-OPER-IMP-001) until an emergency patch can be deployed. The Security Violation Log (REQ-SEC-DTR-002) will be used for forensic analysis.","An unexpected exception type is logged from the Jint engine, or a security audit log shows an attempt to access a forbidden CLR type.","Security Lead","2025-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","The performance benchmark test (REQ-PERF-DTR-002: 10MB JSON in <10s) is flaky and unreliable in the CI/CD environment due to variable performance of shared runners, leading to false-positive build failures and masking of real performance regressions.","4","3","12","Medium","CI/CD pipeline stability, developer productivity, and the ability to reliably detect performance regressions before production.","The performance NFR is tied to specific hardware, but CI environments are often virtualized and shared, leading to inconsistent execution times.","1. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to run performance tests on dedicated, self-hosted runners with guaranteed hardware specifications. 2. Instead of a hard-coded 10-second limit, establish a performance baseline on the dedicated runner and fail tests that deviate by more than a set percentage (e.g., 20%). 3. The test should be run multiple times and average the results to smooth out minor fluctuations.","If dedicated runners are not available, downgrade the performance test to a warning-only status in the main pipeline and run it manually in a controlled environment before each release.","The performance test failure rate exceeds 10% over a 2-week period.","QA Lead","2025-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The database versioning schema for transformation scripts (REQ-FUNC-DTR-005) is implemented with flaws, leading to data corruption, incorrect 'active' version pointers, or an inability to correctly revert to a previous version, compromising the integrity of report logic.","3","4","12","Medium","Script management CRUD (REQ-FUNC-DTR-004), version history, diffing, and rollback functionality. Indirectly impacts all reports using versioned scripts.","Implementing a robust versioning system within a relational database requires careful transactional logic, especially for operations like 'revert' which involves copying data and updating multiple records atomically.","1. Implement extensive integration tests for the versioning logic, covering creation, updates (new versions), reverting, and scenarios where a script is associated with multiple reports. 2. All version-related database operations in the backend service must be wrapped in explicit `DbContext` transactions. 3. Conduct a peer design review of the versioning database schema and service logic before implementation.","If a versioning bug is found in production, the immediate action is to disable the 'revert' functionality via a feature flag. A data-fix script will be required to correct any corrupted version pointers, which must be tested against a production database snapshot.","Application logs show an increase in transaction rollback exceptions or data consistency errors related to script entities.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-07-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The team lacks specialized expertise in WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards, leading to an implementation that passes automated checks but fails manual testing with assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers), resulting in a product that is not truly compliant or usable by all users.","3","3","9","Medium","All UI-related requirements, especially REQ-UI-DTR-002 (Editor), REQ-UI-DTR-003 (Panes), and the overall quality of the Control Panel.","Accessibility is a specialized and often underestimated discipline that requires more than just following a checklist; it requires understanding the user experience of assistive technology.","1. Allocate budget for an external accessibility audit by a specialized firm before the first major release. 2. Provide targeted training for the frontend team on WCAG 2.1 AA and manual testing with screen readers like NVDA/JAWS. 3. Include manual accessibility testing (keyboard-only navigation, screen reader walkthrough) as a mandatory item in the Definition of Done for all UI-related stories.","If major accessibility issues are found late in the cycle, create a dedicated 'Accessibility Debt' backlog and prioritize fixing critical path issues before release. Be transparent about known issues in release notes.","Initial E2E tests with screen reader software reveal significant usability issues not caught by automated tools.","Frontend Lead","2025-06-30","Not Started"
