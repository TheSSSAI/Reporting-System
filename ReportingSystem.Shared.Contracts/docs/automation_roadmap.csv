"Phase 1: Foundational Security & API","High","3","50","xUnit, .NET WebApplicationFactory","120","Very High - Enables rapid, secure backend development and regression testing.","4 hours/month average","8","CI/CD pipeline configured for automated integration testing.","100% of sandbox constraint tests automated; 95% of API endpoints have integration test coverage.","CI environment stability; Complexity of mocking external dependencies.","Use Docker for service dependencies; Standardize mocking patterns.","Ensures core engine is secure and reliable from the start."
"Phase 2: E2E User Journeys & Performance","High","4","35","Cypress or Playwright, xUnit (for benchmark)","150","High - Validates critical user workflows and NFRs, preventing release-blocking defects.","10 hours/month average","24","Dedicated performance testing runner; Staging environment with seeded data.","Core E2E scenarios for script management pass nightly; Performance benchmark is stable.","UI changes breaking selectors; Flakiness of performance tests.","Use stable `data-testid` attributes for selectors; Baseline performance tests instead of using hard limits.","Guarantees a functional and performant user experience for key features."
"Phase 3: Comprehensive & Edge Case Coverage","Medium","3","40","Cypress/Playwright, xUnit","100","Medium - Covers less frequent scenarios, reducing long-tail bugs.","8 hours/month average","","N/A","Increase E2E test coverage from 70% to 90%.","High maintenance cost for complex UI tests.","Focus on API-level testing for complex business logic where possible.","Increases overall product quality and reduces support tickets."
