"RISK-001","Technical","Improper configuration of the Jint sandbox (e.g., failing to disable CLR access, incorrect memory/statement limits) could lead to a critical security vulnerability, allowing remote code execution or denial-of-service attacks on the host server.","3","5","15","High","Core transformation engine implementation (WI-001-1-1), Security and Audit Implementation (WS-003-1). Directly impacts requirements REQ-SEC-DTR-001 and REQ-REL-DTR-001.","Complexity of the Jint library's security options and the high consequence of misconfiguration. A single overlooked option could compromise the entire sandbox.","Implement a dedicated security review and peer code review process specifically for the sandbox configuration code. Create a suite of automated 'malicious' unit tests that attempt to break out of the sandbox, access the file system, and exceed resource limits.","If security cannot be guaranteed by the deadline, keep the entire Data Transformation feature disabled in production using the system-wide feature flag (WI-004-1-1) until all vulnerabilities are remediated.","Any failure in the 'malicious' unit test suite during CI/CD builds. Any entry in the `SecurityViolationLog` during staging or QA testing.","Security Lead","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The requirement to buffer the entire dataset into memory (REQ-DATA-DTR-001) before transformation creates a significant risk of failing the performance benchmark (10MB JSON in <10s) and causing OutOfMemory exceptions for datasets approaching the 256MB limit (REQ-BR-DTR-001).","4","4","16","High","Jint Engine Wrapper Service (WS-001-1), Performance benchmark QA test (REQ-PERF-DTR-002), Data marshalling logic (WI-001-1-2).","Architectural decision to use an in-memory processing model, which is inherently not scalable for very large datasets. Performance overhead from JSON serialization/deserialization between .NET and JavaScript contexts exacerbates this.","Implement performance benchmark tests early in the development cycle and run them continuously in the CI pipeline. Profile the data marshalling process to identify and optimize bottlenecks. Establish clear documentation on performance limits for administrators.","If the benchmark cannot be met, document a lower, achievable dataset size limit and enforce it strictly. Initiate a technical spike to investigate a streaming-based transformation approach for a future release.","Automated performance benchmark test execution time exceeds 8 seconds (80% of target). Prometheus metrics for `script_execution_duration_seconds` show a P95 latency approaching the limit in the staging environment.","Performance Engineer / QA Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Operational","The one-time legacy migration script (REQ-OPER-IMP-002) carries a high risk of data corruption or loss if its logic is flawed. An error could lead to incorrect report associations or unrecoverable loss of legacy transformation logic, jeopardizing the production cutover.","3","5","15","High","Develop One-Time Legacy Migration Script (WI-004-1-2), Production Cutover Plan (REQ-OPER-IMP-004).","Inherent complexity of data migration tasks, potential for unforeseen edge cases in legacy data, and the destructive nature of writing to a new production database.","Develop the script against a recent, anonymized snapshot of production data. Implement extensive logging and a 'dry run' mode that reports intended actions without committing them. Mandate multiple successful test runs in a dedicated staging environment as a go/no-go criterion for production execution.","Delay the decommissioning of the legacy system (REQ-OPER-IMP-005) until the migration is fully verified. In a worst-case scenario, perform a database restore from the pre-migration backup and plan for manual re-entry of critical transformation logic.","The migration script's dry run reports any errors or data validation discrepancies (e.g., mismatched record counts). The script fails during a test run in the staging environment.","Data Migration Lead","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Timeline","The integration of the Monaco Editor into a Vite-based React frontend (WI-002-1-1) is identified as a high-complexity task. Underestimation of this effort could delay the entire Transformation Script Management UI, which is a critical path feature for the project.","4","3","12","Medium","Integrate Monaco Editor for JavaScript Editing (WI-002-1-1), Script Editor and Preview Interface (WS-002-1).","Complex build tool configuration required for Monaco Editor's web workers and assets, which can be difficult to integrate with modern frontend build tools like Vite.","Allocate a dedicated technical spike at the beginning of the project to create a proof-of-concept for the Monaco Editor integration. This will de-risk the task and provide a more accurate effort estimate.","If the Monaco Editor integration proves too time-consuming, pivot to a simpler code editor component (e.g., CodeMirror, react-simple-code-editor) that provides basic syntax highlighting but lacks advanced features. This would satisfy the core requirement, albeit with a reduced user experience.","The proof-of-concept is not successfully integrated and functional by the end of the first development sprint.","Frontend Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The script versioning logic (REQ-FUNC-DTR-005) requires transactional updates to multiple database tables (e.g., creating a new version record while updating the parent script's active version pointer). A failure to ensure atomicity could lead to data inconsistency and corruption.","3","4","12","Medium","Implement Backend CRUD & Versioning for Scripts (WI-002-2-1).","Complexity of managing database transactions across multiple related entities. A partial failure (e.g., new version is created but the parent isn't updated) would leave the system in an invalid state.","Strictly enforce the use of `DbContext.SaveChangesAsync()` within a `TransactionScope` or ensure all related entity modifications are tracked by EF Core before a single `SaveChangesAsync` call. Implement specific integration tests that simulate transaction failures and verify rollback.","Develop an administrative clean-up script that can identify and fix orphaned or inconsistent versioning records in the database. This script would be a last resort for data recovery.","Integration tests for the versioning transaction fail. Data integrity checks in the staging environment reveal orphaned `TransformationScriptVersion` records.","Backend Lead","2024-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","The documented rollback procedure for the production cutover (REQ-OPER-IMP-004) may be flawed, particularly concerning the reversal of database migrations. A failed rollback could prevent the system from returning to a stable state, causing an extended production outage.","2","5","10","Medium","Production Cutover Plan (REQ-OPER-IMP-004), Phased Rollout and Migration (WS-004-1).","The difficulty of perfectly reversing database schema and data changes, combined with the pressure of a live production failure scenario.","Mandate a full, timed dry run of both the deployment and the rollback procedure in a production-like staging environment. Automate the rollback steps (disabling feature flag, running EF Core 'down' migration) into a single script. This test must be a go/no-go criterion for the release.","If rollback fails, the contingency is to 'roll forward' by deploying an emergency hotfix. If that is not possible, the last resort is a full database restore from the pre-deployment backup and a manual redeployment of the previous application version.","The automated rollback test fails in the pre-production environment. The documented procedure takes longer than the allotted maintenance window during the dry run.","Release Manager / DevOps Lead","2024-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","The project's audit trail may have gaps or fail to meet SOC 2 / ISO 27001 requirements for immutability and integrity (REQ-COMP-DTR-001). A failure in auditing could result in non-compliance, reputational damage, and an inability to perform forensic analysis after a security incident.","3","4","12","Medium","Implement RBAC and Audit Trail for Script Management (WI-003-1-2), Security and Audit Implementation (WS-003-1).","The risk of developers overlooking an auditable event or the audit storage mechanism not being sufficiently tamper-evident.","Create a formal checklist of all auditable events based on requirements. Use a standardized auditing interface or a cross-cutting concern (e.g., MediatR pipeline behavior, action filter) to centralize and enforce audit logging. Involve a compliance expert in the design review of the audit log storage.","If audit logs are found to be incomplete post-release, supplement them with detailed application logs to reconstruct event timelines for auditors. Plan an immediate patch to fix the logging gaps.","A manual or automated QA test reveals a sensitive operation (e.g., script association) is not captured in the audit log. A third-party compliance audit identifies a deficiency.","Compliance Officer / Tech Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
