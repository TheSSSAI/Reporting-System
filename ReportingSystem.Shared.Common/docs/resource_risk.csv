"RISK-001","Technical","Improper configuration of the Jint sandbox could lead to a critical security vulnerability, allowing remote code execution or denial-of-service attacks.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-401-02"",""TASK-401-03""]","2","Implement a dedicated security review and a suite of 'malicious' unit tests (TASK-401-04) that attempt to break out of the sandbox.","Keep the entire Data Transformation feature disabled in production using a feature flag until all vulnerabilities are remediated.","Failure in 'malicious' unit test suite during CI/CD builds.","10000","1 week to implement mitigation"
"RISK-002","Technical","The requirement to buffer entire datasets into memory creates a risk of OutOfMemory exceptions and poor performance for large datasets, failing the benchmark.","High","High","[""TASK-401-02""]","1","Implement performance benchmark tests early and run them in CI. Profile the data marshalling process to optimize.","Document a lower, achievable dataset size limit. Spike a streaming-based approach for a future release.","Automated performance benchmark test execution time exceeds 80% of target.","5000","2 weeks to implement mitigation"
"RISK-004","Timeline","The integration of the Monaco Editor into a Vite-based React frontend is high-complexity and could delay the entire Transformation Script Management UI.","High","Medium","[""TASK-045-01"",""TASK-045-02""]","2","Allocate a dedicated technical spike (TASK-045-01) at the beginning of the project to create a proof-of-concept.","If PoC fails, pivot to a simpler code editor component like CodeMirror to satisfy core requirements with reduced UX.","Proof-of-concept is not functional by the end of the first week of Sprint 2.","8000","1 week to implement mitigation"
